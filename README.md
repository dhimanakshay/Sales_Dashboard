Project Overview
In this project, we will be using Power BI to analyze a dataset, clean and process it, and then build an interactive dashboard. Advanced features like DAX queries, forecasting, and the use of maps and filters will also be covered.

Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build a dashboard that provides actionable insights into sales data. We will also demonstrate how to forecast future sales trends based on the available data.

Dataset
You can download the dataset used in this project from the following link: Download Dataset CSV Files

The dataset contains sales-related information across multiple categories, which we will analyze and visualize using Power BI.

Steps
1. Import and Clean Data
Open Power BI and import the CSV file containing the sales data.
Use the Power Query Editor to clean and process the dataset by removing unnecessary columns, filtering out null values, and transforming data types.
2. Dashboard Creation
Create the main dashboard layout using the Power BI canvas.
Use Advanced Charts and Maps to visualize the geographical distribution of sales.
Add Filters and Slicers to allow interactive data exploration.
3. Data Analysis with DAX
Use DAX Queries to create calculated fields, new columns, and tables to derive meaningful insights from the data.
Implement various measures for analyzing sales metrics.
4. Sales Forecasting
Utilize Power BI’s built-in forecasting tools to project future sales trends.
Create visuals that show the forecasting results based on historical data.
5. Export Dashboard
Once the dashboard is complete, export it as a PDF for sharing or presentation purposes.
Project Insights
Sales trends over time, broken down by region, category, or product type.
Key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor business health.
Forecasted sales that allow stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
